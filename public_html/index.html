                <h1>Welcome to themusicofthespheres.com</h1>
                <p>I have a few web apps relating to music (and one relating to, um,
                    well, spheres), and I've got them parked here. Please enjoy.  If
                    you find something that you like or have questions, I'd love to 
                    hear from you, my email address is theatetus7, and it is at gmail.
                </p>

                <h2>MusicSheet and WebAudioGui</h2>
                <p>These two are integrated into one, but if you are only interested in one or 
                    the other, there's no need to dive into both.  This really works best in Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Chrome browser</a>, though most of it 
                    works in <a href="www.mozilla.org/firefox-download">Firefox</a> too.</p>
                <h3><a href='http://sheetmusic.themusicofthespheres.com/'>MusicSheet</a></h3>
                <div class='indent'>
                    <p>This app lets you input multi-part music and then play it back,
                        adjusting the volume of each part independently.  It's easy to 
                        get the hang of. To get started, just navigate to the 
                        <a href='http://sheetmusic.themusicofthespheres.com/'>app</a>, and 
                        select "MusicSheet Tutorial" from the menu you'll find in 
                        the gear icon at the top left.</p>
                    <p>If you sing in a choir this is great for 
                        letting you hear just your part of a section of music, 
                        or just your part with the other parts quiter. If you 
                        are a choir director, you can enter a piece of music and 
                        then export what you've done and emailing it your members 
                        to import for themselves (copyright permitting, of course).
                </div>
                <h3><a href='http://webaudiogui.themusicofthespheres.com/'>WebAudioGUI</a></h3>
                <div class='indent'>
                    <p>As the name suggests, the intention here is to make a graphical
                        user interface for the Web Audio API.  You get graphical audio
                        nodes and you can drag and drop connections among them.  
                        The tutorial here is stored as a series of instruments.
                        Navigate to the <a href='http://webaudiogui.themusicofthespheres.com/'>app</a>
                        (like I said, it's integrated with MusicSheet,
                        so it's all on one page), and then from the gear menu click 
                        "Open Instrument" and start with the instrument called "Tutorial 1."
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you've got the hang of it, MusicSheet can be used as a sequencer 
                        for WebAudioGUI. If you're interested in licensing the software to
                        use instruments or songs that you've created here on your own 
                        website, let's talk. theatetus7, you know, gmail.

                <h2><a href="http://www.psalmsing.com/">PsalmSing</a></h2>
                <p>
                    The idea here is to facilitate the chanting of Psalms with a variety 
                    of different melodies or "tones."  You can compose and save your 
                    own tones here or use a variety of tones provided.  It's been a while
                    since I've worked on this.  Right now, it seems to work only in the
                    <a href="www.mozilla.org/firefox-download">Firefox</a> browser.  There aren't
                    good tutorials yet, but a couple of very rough videos are available 
                    <a href="http://www.psalmsing.com/">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you try to compose or edit a psalm tone, enter notes by clicking 
                    where you want them on the staff, and edit them by right clicking on them.
                </p>
