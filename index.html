        <h1>Welcome to The Music of The Spheres</h1>
                
        <div class="mos_content">
            <div class='mos_section'>
                <p>I have a few web apps relating to music (and one relating to, um,
                    well, spheres), and I've got them parked here. Please enjoy.  If
                    you find something that you like or you have questions, I'd love to 
                    hear from you. My email address is theatetus7, and it is at gmail.
                </p>

                <h2>MusicSheet and WebAudioGUI</h2>
                <p>These two are integrated into one, but if you are only interested in one or 
                    the other, there's no need to dive into both.  This really works best in Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Chrome browser</a>, though most of it 
                    works in <a href="www.mozilla.org/firefox-download">Firefox</a> too.</p>
                <h3><a href='/MusicSheet'>MusicSheet</a></h3>
                <div class='indent'>
                    <p>This app lets you input multi-part music and then play it back,
                        adjusting the volume of each part independently.  It's easy to 
                        get the hang of. To get started, just navigate to the 
                        <a href='/MusicSheet'>app</a>, and 
                        select "MusicSheet Tutorial" from the menu you'll find in 
                        the gear icon at the top right.</p>
                    <p>If you sing in a choir, this is great for 
                        letting you hear just your part of a section of music, 
                        or just your part with the other parts quieter. If you 
                        are a choir director, you can enter a piece of music and 
                        then export what you've done and email it your members 
                        to import for themselves (copyright permitting, of course).
                </div>
                <h3><a href='/WebAudioGUI'>WebAudioGUI</a></h3>
                <div class='indent'>
                    <p>As the name suggests, the intention here is to make a graphical
                        user interface for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio API</a>.  You get flowchart-style graphical audio
                        nodes. You can drag and drop connections among them and adjust their 
                        parameters in a flexible way.  
                        The tutorial here is stored as a series of instruments.
                        Navigate to the <a href='/WebAudioGUI'>app</a>
                        (like I said, it's integrated with MusicSheet,
                        so it's all on one page), and then from the gear menu click 
                        "Open Instrument" and start with the instrument called "Tutorial 1."
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you've got the hang of it, MusicSheet can be used as a sequencer 
                        for WebAudioGUI. If you're interested in licensing the software to
                        use instruments or songs that you've created here on your own 
                        website, let's talk. theatetus7, you know, gmail.

                <h2><a href="/psalmsing">PsalmSing</a></h2>
                <p>
                    The idea here is to facilitate the chanting of psalms with a variety 
                    of different melodies or "tones."  You can compose and save your 
                    own tones here or use a variety of tones provided.  It's been a while
                    since I've worked on this.  Right now, it seems to work only in the
                    <a href="www.mozilla.org/firefox-download">Firefox</a> browser.  There aren't
                    good tutorials yet, but a bit is offered
                    <a href="/psalmsing/app/HelpPages/GettingStarted.php">here</a>. Mobile friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you try to compose or edit a psalm tone, enter notes by clicking 
                    where you want them on the staff, and edit them by right clicking on them.

                    to practice. There are lots of options for how to quiz yourself.  </p>

                <h2><a href="/orbitgame">Orbit Game</a></h2>
                <p>
                    So this one deals with spheres.  It is a physics demo that I might turn
                    into a game sometime.  It's fun to play with.  It very accurately models 
                    planetary motion, except you can pick up and move the sun (you can't actually
                    do that in the real world) and the planet bounces off the sun when they 
                    collide (also doesn't really happen).  If you want to see the trajectory the planet is on,
                    check the "Show Path" box.  You can see that orbits are usually elliptical or hyperbolic.
                    Try to get the planet on a non-colliding elliptical orbit (it's pretty 
                    challenging when "Show Path" is off; it's super easy if you show the 
                    trajectory and use the "pause" feature).  Some fun(?) physics stats are listed.

                <h2><a href="/FOL">Propositional Logic</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Did you take a logic class in college?  I've taught logic and used it
                    in other classes I've taught as well.  This is a program I made for 
                    helping students practice propositional logic (the kind that deals with
                    <code>not</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>if... then...</code>).
                    Choose a level then click <code>Help</code> in the top right corner
                    to get the sense of it.  If you try to actually use it, you'll 
                    see a box on the right side that will give you instructions 
                    on using the program as you go.  Keep your eye on that box.
                    There are a few bugs. It has a back end setup with php and sql
                    that allowed students to submit proofs to me for grading, but it 
                    isn't set up on its current server.
